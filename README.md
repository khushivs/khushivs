- 👋 Hi, I’m @khushivs
- 👀 I’m interested in address our world's most pressing issues using data sciecne and computing tools.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning programming languages as I do not have much experience yet :) 
- 💞️ I’m looking to gain more experience applying the tools I am learning to real-world projects and experiential learning.
